# Mail-Hash

a simple chrome extension that let's you add random hashes to any [plus addressable](https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/addressing.html) email address such as gmail, Fastmail and [many more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_webmail_providers#Features). Please use it in combination with a password manager.

Freely available to [download here](http://chrome-app-store-address.com).

# Why?

Email providers that support plus addressing or tagging enable you to append something to your address and still receive it in your normal inbox.
Let's say your email address is _your.name@gmail.com_. You sign up on facebook with the _your.name+facebook@gmail.com_.
All emails from facebook will still reach your inbox. You can simply block any emails to _your.name+facebook@gmail.com_ and still receive all emails sent to _your.name@gmail.com_.

Let's say a service get's hacked and your credentials wind up in a database like [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

When you use plus tags such as 'facebook' or 'twitter' or 'servicename' it's pretty easy for an attacker to still determine your email address for another service and try to get in with the leaked passwords.

Mail hash adds a random hash to your mail address!
_your.name@gmail.com_ --> _your.name+6as6d7@gmail.com_
_your.name@gmail.com_ --> _your.name+7jsjdl@gmail.com_
_your.name@gmail.com_ --> _your.name+lflfus@gmail.com_

each time you hit the button.
